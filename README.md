🚨 Customer Churn Analysis using Python 🐍
I recently worked on a comprehensive exploratory data analysis project to uncover patterns in customer churn behavior. Here's a snapshot of what I did:

🔍 Key Steps:

Cleaned and converted incorrectly typed columns like TotalCharges.

Transformed binary variables (like SeniorCitizen) for better readability.

Analyzed churn distribution using:

📊 Count plots for overall churn, gender, and senior citizen status

📈 Histograms and pie charts by contract type, tenure, and payment methods

📉 Deep dive into services (internet, phone, security, etc.) and their churn impact

Created stacked bar charts and dual pie charts to compare churn rates effectively.

📌 Key Insights:

~26.5% of customers have churned.

Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn than those with long-term commitments.

Lack of support services (like Tech Support or Online Security) correlates with higher churn.

📎 Tools Used:
Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Numpy

📁 This project helped me strengthen my EDA and visualization skills, and I'd love feedback from the community.

✅ Key Points Summary (Bullet Style)
Objective: Understand why customers are leaving (churn) using EDA.

Data Cleaning:

Fixed TotalCharges column (object → float)

Handled blank values and corrected data types

Transformations:

SeniorCitizen converted to categorical ("YES"/"NO")

Visual Analysis:

Churn distribution by gender, tenure, contract type, and payment method

Pie charts to show proportion of churned vs retained customers

Count plots and stacked bars for service-based churn analysis

Service Insights:

Features like OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, and StreamingServices impact churn

Contract Insight:

Month-to-month contract users are most at risk of churning

Tools Used:

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy

Outcome:

Clear patterns on who churns and why — essential for retention strategies.
